- 👋 Hi, I’m @akhelij a full-stack developer with more than 6 years of experience, primarily in startups and lately as a freelancer.

- 🌱 I have got the chance to work on very diversified projects, which helped me build my Analyses & Communication & Developpement skills!
My strengths lie within Laravel and Vue js, I use TailwindCss as my CSS framework, and I chose Flutter for building mobile apps.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any potentialy interesting project. I'm open to try new technologiesand i would love to share my knowledge, potentially in a technical role.

- 👀 I'm really into entrepreneurship and selling WebApp Services as products, and i like to get involved in projects that seems promising.
